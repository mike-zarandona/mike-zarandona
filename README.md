## Hi, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹

I build and manage products for the web, as well as the ***teams and processes that effectively deliver*** them.

I've earned a reputation as a _product-focused engineering leader_ and a _technically-minded product leader_. I have a passion for building teams and solutions that drive growth and delight customers. By addressing complex technical and business challenges with a data-driven approach, **I consistently execute successful outcomes**. I am passionate about shipping early and often, staying close to customer feedback, and maintaining individual contributorship.
