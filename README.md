## Hi, I'm Mike Zarandona
I build and manage products for the web, as well as the ***teams and processes that effectively deliver*** them.

I've gained a reputation as an _engineer and technical product manager_ with a proclivity for _analytics_. I have a passion for shipping code that drives business growth and delights customers. With a focus on data-driven solutions, I tackle complex technical challenges by solving for _the why_ through qualitative and quantitative data. I have a passion for shipping early and often, and love to stay close to the customer feedback loop.

With a proven track record, I am adept at both driving product roadmaps and executing on the code that brings them to life. My focus on analytics and close attention to customer feedback ensures my teams and I are solving the right problems for both customers and business stakeholders.
